# Pervasive Healthcare
Pervasive Healthcare is an exam project for PC and LSS courses in UNIBO.

This project aims to create a Digital Twin regarding the patient's figure in the healthcare sector.
This system must allow the physical patient to always have their data and medical information up-to-date at their disposal.
The system allows interaction by professional medical figures, such as general practitioners, medical specialists,
nurses and rescuers in real time with the digital twin of the treated patient.
In addition to access to all data by the physical patient, the digital patient must also provide a prediction system for future pathologies,
in order to support doctors in better care for the patient.

The application has been designed with particular attention to the domain and the salient aspects of it. Domain Driven Design accompanied the entire life cycle of the application and with it the DevOps methodology was also applied, which, through the use of Build Automation and Continuous Integration, greatly facilitated the development process.
